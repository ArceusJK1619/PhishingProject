# PhishingProject
Our project is a machine learning based model that detects the phising urls
Packages required to run the code :
  Sklearn,pandas,numpy,pickle,flask,bs4,requests,urllib,process

make sure to have these installed on your system so as to run the programme
We have also added the dataset required and the pickle file for the models accordingly.


The files/folders attached:
  LinearModel.pkl - it contains the Linear reggression based model

  LogisticModel.pkl - it contains the logistic reggression based model
  
  SVMmodel.pkl-it contains the SVC based model
  
  Readme.md - The readme file with the instructions
  
  phishing_site_url.csv - This is the dataset of the sise 2lakh+ entries in it 
  
  The Machine Learning.ipynb - This is the backbone of the project where the data has been proccessed and the models were trained and 
  tested for thier accuracies.

  Static folder - it contains the images that are linked in 

  Templates folder - it has the HTML file that is linked to the Flask Programme 

  process.py - this is the file that houses all the required logics that are to be addressed from the given url 

  app.py - this is the front end the UI of the project 



Steps to run the program :
  Directly run the app.py file with all the required packages installed in the system this will take you to the UI thats the frontend of the system, stay connected to the internet in the process.
